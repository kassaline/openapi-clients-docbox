    "description": "The DOCBOX® REST API makes it possible to integrate the DOCBOX® into third-party programs such as ERP or CRM applications. The third-party programs can access certain DOCBOX® functions, for example to archive documents in the DOCBOX® or to search for documents in it.  The api is available under https://{docbox-host}:{api-port}/api/v2. The default port is 8081 and should not be mistaken with the port of the webapp.  To authenticate to the API you must pass the API-Key header. Api keys can be configured by administrators in the modules->API section. If you are using the cloud version of DOCBOX® you must also pass the Cloud-ID header with your Cloudid.",
